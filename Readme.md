# Flutter Exam 2 - Make a simple flutter app of your own design

## Objectives
* Demonstrate that you can create a flutter app.
* Demonstrate that you can find and use flutter packages.
* Demonstrate that you can make an app that uses good graphic design.

## Requirements
1. Make a simple app from, scratch of your own design. 
2. The app must make use of one new flutter package that you have never used before.
3. Use an online resource for good mobile design, for example you could use (Smashing Magazine Comprehensive Guide to App Design)[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-guide-to-mobile-app-design/]
4. Demonstrate your app to the class on one of the following days: Friday April 24th or Friday May 1st, or Monday May 4th 

## Ideas
* Continue the adventure... Move the adventure game to an app format.
* Some other very simple game.
* A tic-tac-toe game.
* A connect 4 game.
* A useful app that scrapes weather or other information from a reliable online website.
* Any other idea as long as it's not just code copied from the web or code that you used for a different project. This needs to be (mostly) your creation from start to finish. Be sure and clearly document /  credit what code you do re-use or copy! You need to apply this code in a new way. 

## What to submit
* Submit the code you wrote for the app here. 
* Make sure to use a proper .gitignore so you don't submit all the stuff that Flutter makes for Android or Mac!
